# Raylib-SpaceGame
This is the SpaceGame example app that comes with [Beef](https://github.com/beefytech/Beef) but modified to use [raylib-beef](https://github.com/M0n7y5/raylib-beef) instead of SDL2.  
The repository containing the original SpaceGame is [here](https://github.com/beefytech/Beef_website/tree/master/Samples/SpaceGame). 
# Setup
Install the beef IDE and add raylib-beef to BeefLibs in the install directory.
